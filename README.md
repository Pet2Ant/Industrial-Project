# Seminar Registration Platform
This is a project built for WeLead, as part of the internship I took part in, with another person. It is a web application designed to help users create a professional CV and register for seminars, which was tasked to us by WeLead for our third year in college internship. It is built with Java Spring on the backend and React on the frontend, and aims to integrate data collection and seminar registration into a seamless experience.
